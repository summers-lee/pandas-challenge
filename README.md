# pandas-challenge Analysis
I would say the analysis shows many things mostly that the district schools on average need to step their game up to give a excellent education to the children.
It is interesting the less that is spent per-student the better the schore and the large the class the worse you will do, i would say we need to change the class size if possible and diperse the cash in a different way, we can see the budget but how does that break down and what avenues are getting the bulk of the cash in these failing insitutions.
